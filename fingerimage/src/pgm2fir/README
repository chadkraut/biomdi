The pgm2fir program requires the WSQ compression library to be installed
on the system. This library is included in the NBIS distribution available
from the NIST image group. See 
http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.03/nigos/nigos.html

Also needed is a PGM support, provided by netpbm, available at:
http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/
You can usually install NETPBM from your OS distribution, or MacPorts on
Mac OS-X or FreeBSD.
