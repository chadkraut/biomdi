.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to print Finger Minutiae Records
in human-readable form. The output is sent to stdout, while error messages
are sent to stderr. The FMR library is used to read the file, but
.Nm
will attempt to read an ANSI/INCITS 378-2004 format record. If that read
fails, attempts are then made to read in the ISO 19794-2 format: ISO, ISO
Normal Card, and ISO Standard Card. Therefore, error messages may be generated
while the attempt is made to read based on the incorrect format.
.Pp
The minutiae record can be optionally verified, which means the certain fields 
in the record are checked against constraints given in the ANSI/INCITS 378-2004
or ISO 19794-2 specifications.
